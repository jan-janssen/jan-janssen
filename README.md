# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jan and I love automation, because automation allows us to focus on the important things in life.

## Automated Materials Discovery :scientist: 
I currently hold a position of [group leader for Materials Informatics](https://www.mpie.de/5013829/matinf) at the [Max-Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials](https://github.com/eisenforschung), where my team and I automate the discovery of sustainable materials by developing workflows for [ab-initio thermodynamics](https://www.mpie.de/5056820/phasediagram) using [uncertainty quantification](https://www.mpie.de/5062775/dftuncertainty) to achieve a quantitative predictions in agreement with experiments. Our key strength are our workflow frameworks to automate materials discovery, including: [pyiron](https://github.com/pyiron), [executorlib](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) and [Python Workflow Definition](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/python-workflow-definition). If you are an aspiring PhD student and you want to join us on the quest of automating materials discovery, please apply via the [International Max Planck Research School for Sustainable Metallurgy](https://www.mpie.de/2747306/doctoral-program). 

## Automate Everything Else :rocket:
Beyond my professional interest in automation, I also like to automate repetitive tasks in my daily work, incuding: Sorting my emails with [gmailsorter](https://github.com/jan-janssen/gmailsorter) or applying large language model agents to automate atomistic materials science simulation with [LangSim](https://github.com/jan-janssen/LangSim). Finally, in collaboration with a number of automation experts, I maintain [materials informatics related software packages](https://github.com/jan-janssen/conda-forge-contribution) for the [conda-forge community](https://github.com/conda-forge) to enable reproducibility for workflows in materials science and automate the burden of software maintainence - one package at a time.
