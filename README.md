# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jan, the group leader for Materials Informatics at the [Max Planck Institut fÃ¼r Eisenforschung (for iron research)](https://www.mpie.de), where I apply methods from computer science, including but not limited to machine learning, to discover new materials. 
In addition, I lead the development of the [pyiron workflow framework](https://pyiron.org) and maintain [over 600 materials science related software packages](https://github.com/jan-janssen/conda-forge-contribution) on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) to enable reproducible materials science.

## Contributions to the [pyiron project](https://github.com/pyiron):
