# Hi there 👋
I am Jan and I love automation, because it helps me to focus on the important things in life.

## Automate Materials Discovery :scientist: 
Can we build a machine which autonomously discovers novel sustainable materials? This is the aim of the [Materials Informatics](https://www.mpie.de/5013829/matinf) group I lead at the [Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials](https://www.mpie.de). We develop [machine learning models](https://jan-janssen.com/LangSim/) for [ab-initio thermodynamics](https://www.mpie.de/5056820/phasediagram) workflows using [uncertainty quantification](https://www.mpie.de/5062775/dftuncertainty) to achieve quantitative predictions which can be directly compared with experiments. 

This approach is based on our experience of developing the [pyiron](https://github.com/pyiron) workflow framework, followed by the [Python Workflow Definition](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/python-workflow-definition) and finally [executorlib](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) our solutions for up-scaling and rapid prototyping simulation workflows. 

If you are an aspiring PhD student who wants to join us in the quest of automating materials discovery, please apply via the [International Max Planck Research School for Sustainable Metallurgy (IMPRS SusMet)](https://www.mpie.de/2747306/doctoral-program). 

## Automate Everything Else :rocket:
Beyond my professional interest, I aim to automate repetitive tasks in my daily work, incuding: 
* Two-factor authentication wth [pyauthenticator](https://github.com/jan-janssen/pyauthenticator)
* Sorting emails into folders with [gmailsorter](https://github.com/jan-janssen/gmailsorter)
* Software packaging with the [conda-forge community](https://github.com/jan-janssen/conda-forge-contribution)
