# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jan and I love automation, because automation helps me to focus on the important things in life.

## Automate Materials Discovery :scientist: 
I currently hold the position of [group leader for Materials Informatics](https://www.mpie.de/5013829/matinf) at the [Max-Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials](https://github.com/eisenforschung), where my team and I automate the discovery of sustainable materials by developing workflows for [ab-initio thermodynamics](https://www.mpie.de/5056820/phasediagram) using [uncertainty quantification](https://www.mpie.de/5062775/dftuncertainty) to achieve a quantitative predictions which can be directly compared with experiments to ultimately reduce the number of required experiments and accelerate materials discovery. We standardize the development of workflows with the [Python Workflow Definition](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/python-workflow-definition), enable up-scaling workflows with [executorlib](https://github.com/pyiron/executorlib) and develop large language model agents for atomistic simulations using [LangSim](https://github.com/jan-janssen/LangSim), all based on the [pyiron](https://github.com/pyiron) workflow framework.

If you are an aspiring PhD student who wants to join us in the quest of automating materials discovery, please apply via the [International Max-Planck Research School for Sustainable Metallurgy (IMPRS SusMet)](https://www.mpie.de/2747306/doctoral-program). 

## Automate Everything Else :rocket:
Beyond my professional interest I aim to automate repetitive tasks in my daily work, incuding: 
* Two factor authentication wth [pyauthenticator](https://github.com/jan-janssen/pyauthenticator)
* Email sorting with [gmailsorter](https://github.com/jan-janssen/gmailsorter)
* Software packaging with the [conda-forge community](https://github.com/jan-janssen/conda-forge-contribution)
